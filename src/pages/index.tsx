        <p>
          Or√© believes that technology should be accessible by all. They envision a much more inclusive and connected web.
          Ore has been assisting creators in carving out their domain for over six years in order to realize that dream.
          They provide a collaborative approach to designing the best solution through Remokingdom Services. They
          collaborate to create a unique project roadmap while balancing consistency and flexibility. When they are not
          inside a computer, Ore finds balance on a bike and around plants. They frequently use those things to reconnect with and ground themselves
          in the present, as well as remember the bigger picture. Joy.
