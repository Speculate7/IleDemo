          I'm based in the DMV area (DC, MD, VA) and Iâ€™ve been working in tech for over 6 years. Over that time, I've built websites using <b>javascript,
            html, and css</b> and developed webapps using tools amd frameworks such as <b>React, NextJs, Git and Docker</b>.
          I have also worked with various CMS platforms such as <b>Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix</b>.

          <b>Need to update your site?</b> I can perform platform, plugin and content updates for any CMS (wix, squarespace, etc) <br /><br />
          <b>Wanna switch up your domain name?</b> I can help you select, setup and redirect all web or email traffic to the new address.<br /><br />
          <b>Got a brand new design you want the world to see?</b> I use mobile-friendly CSS to implement responsive custom designs and layouts.<br /><br />
          <b>Wanna make your page do something funky, outside the box?</b> I can help you with that too!I write custom code to integrate third-party tools and APIs with your site.
